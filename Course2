Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Praveen Chand
Algorithm Analysis
Algorithm Analysis has taught me the fundamental importance of evaluating computational efficiency before implementation. Through this module, I learned how to analyze time and space complexity using Big O notation, which helps in choosing the most optimal solution for a given problem. Understanding worst-case, best-case, and average-case scenarios has significantly improved my ability to write efficient code. This knowledge is crucial for building scalable applications that can handle large datasets effectively.
