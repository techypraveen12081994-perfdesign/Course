Git and Version Control
I am feeling absolutely great learning Git and GitHub! This module has been a game-changer for me as it introduced me to the world of version control and collaborative development. Understanding concepts like repositories, commits, branches, and merging has given me confidence in managing my code projects effectively. The ability to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with other developers through GitHub has opened up so many possibilities for my programming journey.
